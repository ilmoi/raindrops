## About

The Solana ecosystem has a fragmented and very customized way of storing in-game assets on chain, with as many different formats as there are play-2-earn games. However, the methods of storing ordinary NFT data are standardized in the Metaplex Protocol. The aim of Raindrops is to do the same thing for game assets.

## Development 

[Turbo](https://turborepo.org/) is used for dependency management and building all components.

- Build all: `yarn build`
- Build CLI: `yarn build:cli`
- Build Libs: `yarn build:lib`
- Build Programs: `yarn build:program`
- Format: `yarn format`
- Lint: `yarn lint`
- Run tests locally: `yarn test`

## Publishing

There are two javascript npm packages that can be published. A js SDK and CLI. To publish follow the below commands:

```
# This only needs to be run once. Your login credentials should be cached after running.
yarn npm login

# Publish the JS SDK
yarn workspace "@raindrops-protocol/raindrops" npm publish --access public

# Publish the CLI
yarn workspace "@raindrops-protocol/raindrops-cli" npm publish --access public
```

Be sure to bump the package.json version numbers in the `js/lib/package.json` and `js/cli/package.json` files and push up your modifications.
